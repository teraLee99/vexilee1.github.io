I can't believe it's already July. This year has been flying by. 
<br> <br>
It's taken me much longer than I intended to share about <a href="https://youtu.be/PX-U7-b6rOk" target="_blank">my national park trip</a> I went on back in March. I didn't quite get to do what I wanted photography wise, so that
added a month delay as I couldn't get back down there until the end of April. Then I wanted to make all the music, which added another month. Then I couldn't decide
how I wanted to edit it, so I probably spent an absurd amount of days and weeks creating different renditions. And then, beyond all that, this year has just been difficult with
a lot of hard things happening. But even if it's been a long time, I am still really excited to share all the pictures and videos I got. Better late than never.
 <br> <br>

				<img src="images/blog/arches.jpg" style='height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: contain'>
				<br> <br>
 I initially wanted to do this trip back in 2023. I was so incredibly scared though, that I decided to cut it short and I only managed to go to a couple of the parks. 
 That trip was also my first time trying to car camp out on public land, and that in itself was tremendously nerve wracking. I'm a bit more seasoned now, at least 
 I like to think I am. So finding spots comes a little more naturally. However, I still have a constant fear of my car blowing up somewhere. The excessive worry followed 
 me around this time too, but I just pushed through and hoped for the best. I mean, I had a lot of things done beforehand - engine mounts, oil change, tire rotation, 
 new battery. But it's still a 20 year old car, and who knows when a belt is just gonna snap or something. 
 <br> <br>
 Somehow, the car chugged along just fine though. Took me to Zion, Bryce, Kodachrome, Capitol Reef, Goblin Valley, Canyonlands, Dead Horse, and Arches. Provided me a cozy space to 
 rest each night, from the forest to a canyon overlook to right off the highway in the desert. Started up each morning to take me from one middle of nowhere place to the next. 
 I won't have to wonder now if I would've made it if I had just been brave enough to keep driving. I finally did the full trip with this car, and that is unbelievably satisfying. 
 				<br> <br>
			<img src="images/blog/arches3.jpg" alt="" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'>	
				<br> <br>
 Of course, I have a million more ideas for how I could have done a better job with the timelapses. If I had just done that setting instead, or let it go just a little bit longer.
 There will always be another view, another angle, another sunrise that needs to be captured. I could do this same trip 100 times, and still find new things to look at. I'd love
 to do the trip again someday, but spend a lot longer at each location. I can't seem to get enough. 
 <br> <br>
 At the start of the year, I imagined constantly camping come spring and summer. That's what I really held onto through winter. But so far, I have only been out camping 2 times.
 When I went back to the parks in April, I actually rented a car and stayed at a Motel 6 for a couple nights. So I'm not counting that as a car camping adventure.

<br> <br>
In May, I did
 go up the canyon for a night and pay to camp. I'll be sharing about that trip next. Things haven't been going to plan and the year is panning out 
much differently than I expected. But I hope to start getting out there more, to enjoy the rest of the season.

			<h3 class="blog-post-date" align="center">Dec 18th, 2024</h3>
			<p class="blog-post-content">
		It has been such a fun year. I have learned so much, gone to many beautiful places, and decided on some ideas for what I want to do next. 
		<br> <br>
		I started the year knowing that I wanted to go camping as much as possible. I wasn't sure how I'd make it happen, but I knew that
		adventuring out and seeing some new places would be good for me. I kept thinking back to my 2023 trip to Southern Utah, and how incredible that experience was. 
		I wanted more of that.
		<br> <br> 
		So, I made a list of the places that I wanted to go. I thought about the logistics, what it would mean to actually drive there.
		The main front and center thought was always: "Will my car make it?" I had serious doubts, felt uncertain, spent time questioning 
		my life choices. Debated if it was worth risking getting stranded somewhere. 
		<br> <br>
		But at the end of the day, I knew this was something I really wanted to do. I waited for warmer weather, and then I set out.
		<br> <br>
		My first trip of the year was next to the lake. Then I went to the canyon, the mountains, the desert. After that, I went to the city and parked for
		the night in front of the capitol building - I cannot convey how truly funny I found that. I barely slept due to traffic noise, and I ended up 
		leaving at like 5 AM, but that still ranks as one of my favorite places I went. Following that restless night, I drove straight to the mountains, 
		took an amazing nap, and then made some instant noodles. I found the juxtaposition - busy city to peaceful nature - so satisfying; 
		that I could feel as though I was in an entirely different place after only an hour of driving. It was such an interesting spring and summer.
		<br> <br>

		<img src="images/blog/forest.jpg" style='height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: contain'>
		<br> <br>
		In the fall, I went back to the desert, venturing a little bit further this time. Spent a few relaxing days at a hot springs.
		Then to the mountains, the canyon. For my final trip of the year, 
		I found myself back at the lake. Looking over my list now, I ended up going to nearly
		every place. That is such a cool feeling, knowing how I felt at the beginning of the 
		year to now having all of this to look back on. I'm excited to keep 
		building from here. 
		<br> <br>
		With it winter now, the canyons closed, and the places my car can safely access limited, I don't imagine I'll be going on any trips for a good while. 
		I will keep on with my usual of camping out with my horse, and continue making plans for next year.
		<br> <br>
		Before I go, I just want to make sure I express how important these trips are to me. Even if all I'm doing is sitting in my car somewhere with a great view, 
		maybe with some string lights on, maybe watching a movie, laughing to myself about how bizarre my life is - for me, that's really all I'm after.

			<h3 class="blog-post-date" align="center">August 30th, 2024</h3>
			<p class="blog-post-content">
			So far this summer, I have ventured out and slept in my car in quite a few different locations. 
			Each has been a learning experience for me, and I am slowly getting more confident
			with finding spots. 
				<br> <br>
			But my usual way of camping is next to my horse, Evie. I don't even think twice about it anymore - it is the most normal thing to me. 
			There have been many nights when I was lying in my car, trying to sleep, and suddenly I'll hear distant hoof beats. 
			I'll sit up just in time to see the silhouette of Evie galloping past. And other times when I woke up, and the act of me 
			sitting up caused my car to make a creaking sound. If Evie is close by, I'll hear an expectant nicker in response, as she knows 
			that means I'm awake and should be getting up to feed her now. I always oblige, but sometimes I take my sweet time. In those instances, 
			Evie will stand and stare at my car as long as it takes.
				<br> <br>
			I don't know how it is that I got lucky enough to not only have a horse, but be able to do 
			things like eat dinner and camp with her. I deeply cherish every moment.
				<br> <br>
			In the future, I might share more about Evie & I's camping experiences; although, on here, 
			I want to focus more on sharing my individual camping trips on public land. I just wanted to make at 
			least one video that provided a bit more context about my situation, and why I initially started car 
			camping on a more regular basis.
				<br> <br>
			I have a few locations in mind for the next few months, and I am mapping out what I would like to do while there. 
			I did have a few trips this summer that I decided not to share because I wasn't very comfortable with the footage I got. 
			I did still learn a great deal from those trips. I plan on revisiting those locations again sometime, and utilizing what I 
			learned to create something that I feel more excited about. 
				<br> <br>
			Finally, I'll leave you with this cheesy instrumental I made about my horse:

			<h3 class="blog-post-date" align="center">Feb 4th, 2024</h3>
			<p class="blog-post-content">
			I have always liked the idea of creating my own site, and it's finally here! I spent the last few weeks
			working on it - watching countless videos and reading forums. I know it isn't perfect, but I have learned a great deal
			and it's been a lot of fun! I will likely change some things as I go; the current state of the site is not final. <br> <br> I can't remember exactly 
			when I started my original WordPress page. 
			I remember writing on there as far back as 2014, but I'm not sure if I called it 'Vexilee' back then. It served me well and I always loved sharing on
			there - probably more than I should've. 'Vexilee.com' will be used for similar things: blog posts, pictures. 
			While it's missing some 
			elements (such as comment sections), this new page is personalized to better reflect more areas of my life.<br> <br> 
			Going forward, I hope to utilize this space to share details about my adventures. 
			I have many upcoming camping trips for this coming spring and summer that I intend on videoing and writing about. I also hope to continue working on
			my Etsy store, and creating more crochet items. I don't have any exact plans in mind
			for what I will share on this site - just general ideas and rough guesses. I'm sure things will change as time goes on! <br> <br>
			Thank you for reading, and thank you for being here!
