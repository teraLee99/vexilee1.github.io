I can't believe it's already July. This year has been flying by. 
<br> <br>
It's taken me much longer than I intended to share about <a href="https://youtu.be/PX-U7-b6rOk" target="_blank">my national park trip</a> I went on back in March. I didn't quite get to do what I wanted photography wise, so that
added a month delay as I couldn't get back down there until the end of April. Then I wanted to make all the music, which added another month. Then I couldn't decide
how I wanted to edit it, so I probably spent an absurd amount of days and weeks creating different renditions. And then, beyond all that, this year has just been difficult with
a lot of hard things happening. But even if it's been a long time, I am still really excited to share all the pictures and videos I got. Better late than never.
 <br> <br>

				<img src="images/blog/arches.jpg" style='height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: contain'>
				<br> <br>
 I initially wanted to do this trip back in 2023. I was so incredibly scared though, that I decided to cut it short and I only managed to go to a couple of the parks. 
 That trip was also my first time trying to car camp out on public land, and that in itself was tremendously nerve wracking. I'm a bit more seasoned now, at least 
 I like to think I am. So finding spots comes a little more naturally. However, I still have a constant fear of my car blowing up somewhere. The excessive worry followed 
 me around this time too, but I just pushed through and hoped for the best. I mean, I had a lot of things done beforehand - engine mounts, oil change, tire rotation, 
 new battery. But it's still a 20 year old car, and who knows when a belt is just gonna snap or something. 
 <br> <br>
 Somehow, the car chugged along just fine though. Took me to Zion, Bryce, Kodachrome, Capitol Reef, Goblin Valley, Canyonlands, Dead Horse, and Arches. Provided me a cozy space to 
 rest each night, from the forest to a canyon overlook to right off the highway in the desert. Started up each morning to take me from one middle of nowhere place to the next. 
 I won't have to wonder now if I would've made it if I had just been brave enough to keep driving. I finally did the full trip with this car, and that is unbelievably satisfying. 
 				<br> <br>
			<img src="images/blog/arches3.jpg" alt="" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'>	
				<br> <br>
 Of course, I have a million more ideas for how I could have done a better job with the timelapses. If I had just done that setting instead, or let it go just a little bit longer.
 There will always be another view, another angle, another sunrise that needs to be captured. I could do this same trip 100 times, and still find new things to look at. I'd love
 to do the trip again someday, but spend a lot longer at each location. I can't seem to get enough. 
 <br> <br>
 At the start of the year, I imagined constantly camping come spring and summer. That's what I really held onto through winter. But so far, I have only been out camping 2 times.
 When I went back to the parks in April, I actually rented a car and stayed at a Motel 6 for a couple nights. So I'm not counting that as a car camping adventure.

<br> <br>
In May, I did
 go up the canyon for a night and pay to camp. I'll be sharing about that trip next. Things haven't been going to plan and the year is panning out 
much differently than I expected. But I hope to start getting out there more, to enjoy the rest of the season.

			<h3 class="blog-post-date" align="center">Dec 18th, 2024</h3>
			<p class="blog-post-content">
		It has been such a fun year. I have learned so much, gone to many beautiful places, and decided on some ideas for what I want to do next. 
		<br> <br>
		I started the year knowing that I wanted to go camping as much as possible. I wasn't sure how I'd make it happen, but I knew that
		adventuring out and seeing some new places would be good for me. I kept thinking back to my 2023 trip to Southern Utah, and how incredible that experience was. 
		I wanted more of that.
		<br> <br> 
		So, I made a list of the places that I wanted to go. I thought about the logistics, what it would mean to actually drive there.
		The main front and center thought was always: "Will my car make it?" I had serious doubts, felt uncertain, spent time questioning 
		my life choices. Debated if it was worth risking getting stranded somewhere. 
		<br> <br>
		But at the end of the day, I knew this was something I really wanted to do. I waited for warmer weather, and then I set out.
		<br> <br>
		My first trip of the year was next to the lake. Then I went to the canyon, the mountains, the desert. After that, I went to the city and parked for
		the night in front of the capitol building - I cannot convey how truly funny I found that. I barely slept due to traffic noise, and I ended up 
		leaving at like 5 AM, but that still ranks as one of my favorite places I went. Following that restless night, I drove straight to the mountains, 
		took an amazing nap, and then made some instant noodles. I found the juxtaposition - busy city to peaceful nature - so satisfying; 
		that I could feel as though I was in an entirely different place after only an hour of driving. It was such an interesting spring and summer.
		<br> <br>

		<img src="images/blog/forest.jpg" style='height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: contain'>
		<br> <br>
		In the fall, I went back to the desert, venturing a little bit further this time. Spent a few relaxing days at a hot springs.
		Then to the mountains, the canyon. For my final trip of the year, 
		I found myself back at the lake. Looking over my list now, I ended up going to nearly
		every place. That is such a cool feeling, knowing how I felt at the beginning of the 
		year to now having all of this to look back on. I'm excited to keep 
		building from here. 
		<br> <br>
		With it winter now, the canyons closed, and the places my car can safely access limited, I don't imagine I'll be going on any trips for a good while. 
		I will keep on with my usual of camping out with my horse, and continue making plans for next year.
		<br> <br>
		Before I go, I just want to make sure I express how important these trips are to me. Even if all I'm doing is sitting in my car somewhere with a great view, 
		maybe with some string lights on, maybe watching a movie, laughing to myself about how bizarre my life is - for me, that's really all I'm after.

			<h1 class="blog-post-title" align="center">My Typical Way of Camping</h1>
			<h3 class="blog-post-date" align="center">August 30th, 2024</h3>
			<p class="blog-post-content">
			So far this summer, I have ventured out and slept in my car in quite a few different locations. 
			Each has been a learning experience for me, and I am slowly getting more confident
			with finding spots. 
				<br> <br>
			But my usual way of camping is next to my horse, Evie. I don't even think twice about it anymore - it is the most normal thing to me. 
			There have been many nights when I was lying in my car, trying to sleep, and suddenly I'll hear distant hoof beats. 
			I'll sit up just in time to see the silhouette of Evie galloping past. And other times when I woke up, and the act of me 
			sitting up caused my car to make a creaking sound. If Evie is close by, I'll hear an expectant nicker in response, as she knows 
			that means I'm awake and should be getting up to feed her now. I always oblige, but sometimes I take my sweet time. In those instances, 
			Evie will stand and stare at my car as long as it takes.
				<br> <br>
			I don't know how it is that I got lucky enough to not only have a horse, but be able to do 
			things like eat dinner and camp with her. I deeply cherish every moment.
				<br> <br>
			In the future, I might share more about Evie & I's camping experiences; although, on here, 
			I want to focus more on sharing my individual camping trips on public land. I just wanted to make at 
			least one video that provided a bit more context about my situation, and why I initially started car 
			camping on a more regular basis.
				<br> <br>
			I have a few locations in mind for the next few months, and I am mapping out what I would like to do while there. 
			I did have a few trips this summer that I decided not to share because I wasn't very comfortable with the footage I got. 
			I did still learn a great deal from those trips. I plan on revisiting those locations again sometime, and utilizing what I 
			learned to create something that I feel more excited about. 
				<br> <br>
			Finally, I'll leave you with this cheesy instrumental I made about my horse:

			<h3 class="blog-post-date" align="center">Feb 4th, 2024</h3>
			<p class="blog-post-content">
			I have always liked the idea of creating my own site, and it's finally here! I spent the last few weeks
			working on it - watching countless videos and reading forums. I know it isn't perfect, but I have learned a great deal
			and it's been a lot of fun! I will likely change some things as I go; the current state of the site is not final. <br> <br> I can't remember exactly 
			when I started my original WordPress page. 
			I remember writing on there as far back as 2014, but I'm not sure if I called it 'Vexilee' back then. It served me well and I always loved sharing on
			there - probably more than I should've. 'Vexilee.com' will be used for similar things: blog posts, pictures. 
			While it's missing some 
			elements (such as comment sections), this new page is personalized to better reflect more areas of my life.<br> <br> 
			Going forward, I hope to utilize this space to share details about my adventures. 
			I have many upcoming camping trips for this coming spring and summer that I intend on videoing and writing about. I also hope to continue working on
			my Etsy store, and creating more crochet items. I don't have any exact plans in mind
			for what I will share on this site - just general ideas and rough guesses. I'm sure things will change as time goes on! <br> <br>
			Thank you for reading, and thank you for being here!

		<p class="blog-post-content">
				The first time I ever slept in my car was the summer of 2017. I was 17 years old. For whatever reason, I decided I didn't want to go home that day. 
				I walked home from work, and got into my car that I had parked a block from my house. It was outside an apartment building, and my car was sandwiched 
				within a line of cars. <br> <br> 
			I put up my front window shade, pushed my front seats all the way forward, and crawled onto the backseat. I 
			covered myself with blankets and closed my eyes. I don't remember anyone walking by, and hardly any cars passed. It was a fairly quiet night; the only 
			disturbance being the street lights above. I laid there for probably 5 hours, and maybe I slept a combined total of an hour. At 3 a.m., I decided to give up,
			and I walked the block back to my house. <br> <br>That same summer, I took a road trip with my mom to San Francisco. We rented a car - a luxurious Toyota 
			Corolla. In an effort to save money and make the trip as economical as possible, we opted to sleep in the car most nights rather than stay at a hotel. <br> <br>
			The first night, we found ourselves in Reno, Nevada outside a casino called 'Boomtown'. We parked in the outskirts; my mom in the driver's seat and me on 
			the passenger side. We reclined the seats back as far as the car allowed, and tried to sleep. I remember some people walked by in front of the car. I don't 
			know if they could see us, but I imagine we looked wildly miserable. I laid there staring at the large, brightly lit sign on the casino for too many hours. 
			Similar to my first experience sleeping in my car, my sleep was segmented and interrupted. However, at some point, I must've been sleeping pretty decently 
			because the next thing I remember was waking up at a Chevron, as my mom decided to get gas. It was 4 a.m., and the world felt so unfamiliar and confusing. <br> <br>
			We carried on the rest of the way to California. We spent a night in the parking lot of a WalMart in Fresno I believe it was, and at a Target in Santa Rosa. 
			We did splurge for two nights out of the seven and got a hotel room. Maybe it's weird to say, but I think back on those times so fondly. Neither of 
			us slept well in that car, and we'd wake up feeling like we got hit by a truck. But something about it was satisfying - knowing that we made it 
			work and could do it. I had a great deal of fun on that trip. <br> <br>After those experiences, it wouldn't be until I was 20 that I would start sleeping 
			in my car more regularly. I still had - and still do to this day - the same car that I did at 17. It took a lot of trial and error, and many uncomfortable nights, 
			but eventually I fine tuned things to where my car is amazing to sleep in now. I go to sleep and stay asleep, and wake up feeling refreshed. What made the biggest 
			difference for me was laying my backseat down. I sleep with my legs in the trunk and the upper part of my body on the back of the backseat. I have to sleep on 
			a diagonal in order to fully stretch out. I don't have a mattress of any kind in the car, and I use pillows and blankets as cushions. It works fairly well, 
			and I am content in the car. <br> <br>This past summer, I had my first nights car camping on BLM land. It's something I've wanted to do for a couple years now, 
			but I've always been too nervous. I would conjure up a million reasons why I shouldn't go - what if my car breaks down? what if I can't find a place to camp? 
			what if an emergency happens and I'm stuck out in the middle of nowhere? what if someone knocks on my window in the night and kicks me out? and on and on.. 
			But this summer, those reasons were all replaced with an igniting excitement. I quit my job in April, graduated college in May; I was freed up 
			from most of my obligations and responsibilities, and I wasn't sure how long that would last. So what the hell, why not drive a few hours so I could sleep 
			in my car in the desert for awhile? <br> <br> I made my way to Moab, Utah. I drove up to Canyonlands, but I got there too late in the evening; the
			visitor's center was closed. I turned around, and started trying to find a place to sleep for the night. Before I embarked on this trip, I made a list of 
			free camp sites in the area, which I'm thankful I did as cell service was spotty there. I realized pretty quickly, though, that many of the places I wrote down 
			were not actually accessible with my little two wheel drive sedan. I started freaking out, not knowing what I would do. I even started considering driving 
			home. <br> <br>Just when I thought all was lost and was about to give up, I passed a turn-off that had one of those big wooden information signs. I did a u-turn, 
			and went to check it out. I parked and walked over to read the sign. To my disappointment, it was just talking about the rules for off-roading. I walked 
			around a bit more, and something piqued my interest: a sign that said 'no camping beyond this point'. Oh? I kept walking and to my relief, I finally spotted 
			one of those rock fire rings. I knew I would be fine to park next to it and camp there, so I did. I then got out of my car and ran around a bit, beyond excited to 
			have found a place. Here is a picture I took that evening: <br> 
			
			<img src="images/blog/expcarcamp/carsky2.JPG" alt="" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'>
			
			The sunset was amazing that day. The wind was wild. I ate a can of mixed vegetables for dinner. I went to sleep in total darkness, with only the stars shining above.
			That first night, with the wind raging, it was a noisy night. At times, it almost sounded like people yelling. I slept there the next night, and 
			there was no wind then. It was perfectly still and silent, the darkness feeling more palpable now. I felt the tiniest bit unsettled because if there were 
			any noises, I would definitely hear every single one. But I didn't let that bother me. I slept so deep and so sound. <br> <br>I'll never forget those first nights out 
			in the desert. I was no stranger to sleeping in my car at that point, but this was an entirely different experience. I was far from home and far from anyone I knew.
			Internet research told me I could camp on public land, but it's different when you personally actually go out and do it. I didn't have verbal confirmation that I was 
			allowed to be there, I didn't ask permission. However, as I laid there falling asleep, I felt incredibly safe and secure. I didn't feel on edge in the slightest. 
			And that is such an exhilarating feeling. To be out in nature, sleeping for free, in a place that you are welcome to be. No matter what happens in my life, 
			there are spaces that I am allowed to occupy that do not take having a lease or income. That is so freeing, so encouraging. <br> <br>
			I have big plans for next year, once the weather warms up again. My car has been having a couple issues as of late, so I'll need to get a few things 
			checked before I set out too far. I do want to clarify that at this time, I am not living in my car fulltime. And most of the times when I am sleeping in my 
			car, I'm on privately owned land where I don't have to worry about anyone bothering me. I know I am fortunate to be able to experience sleeping in my car as a 
			recreational, carefree activity. I do not take that for granted. </p>

		It was a tumultuous time, as is now. <br>
		Those bittersweet September days, <br>
		It rained every now and then, <br>
		But the blistering heat stole the show more often than not. <br>
		I watched everything move around me, <br>
		I felt the fear, <br>
		the strain. <br>
		I reacted by running. <br>
		I wanted nothing to do with cause and effect. <br> <br>
		One quiet night, <br>
		In that in between stage <br>
		Where the world remains cloaked in darkness, <br>
		Yet the first birds have already begun greeting the sunrise. <br>
		I awoke from a short sleep. <br>
		In the next room over, <br>
		<i> Dreams </i> by Fleetwood Mac was softly playing, <br>
		If I wasn't paying attention, I would have missed it. <br>
		But I intently listened, <br>
		Lying in that brief calmness, <br>
		Nothing else in the world mattered. <br>
		I existed to hear that song, <br>
		To lie on that firm couch. <br>
		How quickly the hours passed, <br> <br>
		That moment may as well as never happened, <br>
		And yet it did. <br>
		I still hold onto that feeling. <br> <br>
		From there, I ran back. <br>
		I was a witness, <br>
		But now I was a partaker. <br>
		Even if for only one day. <br>
		And it was a perfect one day. <br>
		It feels like forever, <br>
		When you're in it, <br>
		It always ends up passing in the blink of an eye, though. <br>
		No matter how intently you stop to take it in, <br>
		It'll be over before you know it. <br>

			<h3 class="blog-post-date" align="center">May 4, 2022</h3>
			<p align="center" class="blog-post-content">
			In the scheme of my life, I have experienced many segments.
			Blocking outs of which feeling defines each era.
			The past 2 years have been a lifetime of their own.
			But before that, and even a few years before that, I remember a very different existence. <br> <br>
			I felt those hard things, I cried often, and I collapsed in on myself,
			I also enveloped myself in this world. I felt each corner, the wealth of being fully present.
			The warm, yet cool, evening air in July.
			I sat out in the grass for hours and hours, and I captured 1,200 moments.
			I still have each one saved.
			If not for those, my memory would have colluded out every ounce of that by now. <br> <br>
			These days, these times, I am steadfast in bland.
			I feel those hard things, and I stay put.
			The fun things like taking pictures for no reason at all have ebbed out of importance.
			"What's the point in that? I'm too busy."
			I remember what it was like to do things for the sake of doing them.
			I stood nothing to gain, yet I thrived off those feelings.
			I looked forward to the times when I could forget. <br> <br>
			Do we exist to maintain?
			To be focused, driven, and functional?
			Or are we supposed to enjoy? 
			Drink deeply from the wells of our passions, from the eternal youth of our souls? <br> <br>
			It is a cliche, I realize. <br> <br>
			Life is not whimsical, and magic does not exist. I know the laws of physics, the laws of man.
			But internally, there must be some part of all of us that recognizes those indescribable moments.
			When words do not matter.
			What someone said to you yesterday is forgotten.
			The mistakes of the past dissipate.
			All that exists, all that matters, is what's right in front of you at that second. <br> <br>
			For me, it was always those summer evenings, when dusk would not creep in at 5 pm.
			The light would stick around for so many hours, there was plenty of time to indulge.
			I have not done that in years.
